### oh my zsh

#### install and setup as default
via [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) and
[installing-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)


1. install zsh : built-in or brew
2. Verify installation by running ```zsh --version```. Expected result: zsh 4.3.9 or more recent.
3. Make it your default shell:
```shell
$ chsh -s $(/bin/zsh)
```
\*Note that this will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (/etc/shells) or if you don't have permission to use chsh.


4. Log out and login back again to use your new default shell.
5. Test that it worked with ```$ echo $SHELL```. Expected result: /bin/zsh

#### Theme
- [lambda mod](https://github.com/halfo/lambda-mod-zsh-theme/)


1. clone the repository and follow the steps below.
   ```shell
   $ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/
   $ git clone https://github.com/halfo/lambda-mod-zsh-theme.git
   $ mv lambda-mod-zsh-theme/lambda-mod.zsh-theme ./themes/
   ```

2. overwrite ```ZSH_THEME``` in ```~/.zshrc ```. It will look like:
   ```
   ZSH_THEME="lambda-mod"
   ```

#### [Colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)
This enhances the terminal command `ls` with color and icons.

1. Make sure you've installed `ruby` and [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
```sh
# Install nerd-fonts by homebrew
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
```

2. Install the `colorls` ruby gem
```sh
gem install colorls
```

3. Enable tab completion for flags by entering following line to `~/.zshrc`
```sh
source $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/tab_complete.sh
```

4. Then all set and enjoy.

**Custom setting**

1. Short command by `alias`. e.g. try to set alias `ls` to `colorls` in `~/.zshrc` by default.
```sh
alias ls='colorls'
```

2. Make your custom style
```sh
code $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml
```
